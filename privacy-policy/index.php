			<p id="one"><strong>How we collect information</strong></p>
			<p>In order to provide our services, we may collect or receive information from our publishers, supply-side platforms, ad networks, and other providers of mobile ad inventory information (“Clients”).  This information may include location data, IP address, context, gender, age, other demographic information, device data such as mobile identifiers, carrier network information, the mobile website or mobile app used, and cookie or pixel tag data.  We may also collect information about how consumers interact with the ads we deliver including information such as but not limited to click thru rates, secondary clicks on PPMN-hosted landing pages, and device information. The ad requests we receive may consist of personally identifiable information (PII), non-personally identifiable information (NPII) or both.  While we may receive personal information, we do not attempt to identify the individual consumer the information is associated with. </p>

			<p id="three"><strong>How We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></p>
			<p>
				When you access our website we may place small data files on your computer or other device. These data files may be cookies, pixel tags, "Flash cookies," or other local storage provided by your browser or associated applications ("Cookies"). We use these technologies to: recognize you; customize PPMN Services, content; and to promote trust and safety across our sites.</p><p>We use both session and persistent Cookies. Session Cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent Cookies remain on your device until you erase them or they expire.</p><p>We encode our Cookies so that we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our Cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website and PPMN Services. Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling Cookies.</p><p>You may encounter PPMN Cookies on websites that we do not control. For example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a Cookie placed by the web page or application. Likewise, these third parties may place their own Cookies that are not subject to our control and the PPMN User Privacy Notice does not cover their use.</p><p>Do Not Track:  California law requires us to say how we respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there is currently no industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT, we do not currently respond to DNT signals. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
